## How to Run the App

This repo contains a Shiny application organized into three separate files:

- `ui.R` – defines the user interface layout
- `server.R` – contains the server-side logic
- `app.R` – serves as the main script that sources both `ui.R` and `server.R`, and launches the app

To run the application:

1. Download all three files in this folder.
2. Open `app.R` in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Execute the entire script in `app.R` to launch the Shiny app.

This project was created as part of my practice in R Shiny UI development, with the goal of improving modular design and hands-on experience with building interactive applications.
